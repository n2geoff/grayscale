# Grayscale CSS

A Minimalist Dream of CSS

Grayscale CSS provides a minimalist approach to styling, placing layout in the fore-front, removing distractions like color, allowing  developers to prototype layouts rapidly -- add color later.

Extend with minimal styles to create your final theme/design.

All in, this package is **only 2kb gzipped!**
